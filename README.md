# ExploreLC
Kiosk project for Explore Licking County (https://explorelc.org)

This project is designed to run in a locked-down Chromium browser with Kiosk Mode enabled. To start, download the files and place them
on a Raspberry Pi connected to a touchscreen, then run in yarn:

yarn 

yarn start 

If you'd like, you can also build the project and serve it instead.


The kiosk contains offline translation and screenreading functions, a QR code generator for mobile device interaction, and various information
about the tourist attractions available in Licking County, OH.
